To incorporate your screenshot as a sample of the output, I have updated the **Strategic Implementations** section of the README. This visual sample directly correlates to the signals generated in your notebook's "Today's Alpha Signals" query.

# ❄️ Snowflake Alpha Discovery

This repository demonstrates how hedge funds and quantitative asset managers can leverage **Snowflake** and **Snowpark Python** to build a modern alpha research environment. By unifying market data with alternative data, we identify trade signals and implement sophisticated strategies directly within the Data Cloud.

## 🚀 Overview

The project shifts quantitative research from local environments to the data, utilizing:

* **Snowpark Python:** For high-performance factor computation without moving data.
* **Cortex AI:** For institutional-grade sentiment analysis of news headlines using `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT`.
* **Time-Series Analytics:** Using `ASOF JOIN` for robust factor lookbacks that handle data gaps and holidays natively.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Data Platform:** Snowflake.
* **Languages:** Python (Snowpark), SQL.
* **AI/ML:** Snowflake Cortex (LLM Sentiment Analysis).
* **Visualization:** Streamlit and Plotly.
* **Data Source:** Cybersyn Financial & Economic Essentials via Snowflake Marketplace.

## 📈 Multi-Factor Alpha Architecture

The research engine focuses on three primary drivers of excess return (Alpha), utilizing **Cross-Sectional Ranking** to ensure signals are comparable across the universe.

### 1. Momentum Alpha (Relative Strength)

* **Logic:** Captures stocks outperforming or underperforming their peers over a ~20 trading day window.
* **Implementation:** Uses `ASOF JOIN` to anchor the price exactly 28 calendar days ago, providing a robust calculation even with market gaps.
* **Normalization:** Raw returns are converted into a `PERCENT_RANK()` (0.0 to 1.0).

### 2. Volatility Alpha (Risk-Adjusted Anomaly)

* **Logic:** Measures the annualized standard deviation of daily returns over the last 20 sessions.
* **Implementation:** Utilizes Snowpark window functions (`STDDEV` over `19 PRECEDING`).
* **Normalization:** Stocks are ranked such that a high rank (1.0) represents the **lowest** volatility.

### 3. Sentiment Alpha (Alternative Data Edge)

* **Logic:** Quantifies news mood using Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **Implementation:** Leverages `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT()` to score headlines from -1 to 1.
* **Normalization:** Daily scores are averaged and ranked cross-sectionally.

## ⚖️ Strategic Implementations

### 1. Long-Short Equity Strategy

Factors are combined into a **Composite Alpha Score** to target outperformance by capturing the "spread" between relative winners and losers:

* **Weighted Signal Calculation:** 
* **Signal Thresholds:**
* **STRONG_BUY**: Alpha Score > 0.2.
* **BUY**: Alpha Score > 0.05.
* **HOLD**: Alpha Score between -0.05 and 0.05.
* **SELL**: Alpha Score < -0.05.
* **STRONG_SELL**: Alpha Score < -0.2.



**Sample Strategy Output:**
Below is a sample of the real-time trading recommendations generated by the model:

### 2. Market-Neutral Pairs Trading (Statistical Arbitrage)

To generate returns independent of market direction, the engine includes a pairs trading module:

* **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying highly correlated intra-sector pairs (e.g., `GS` ↔ `JPM`).
* **Divergence Detection:** Calculating real-time Z-scores to identify when price ratios deviate from their historical mean.
* **Convergence Execution:** Executing a market-neutral trade by shorting the outperformer and longing the underperformer, profiting as the pair converges.

## 📂 Production Readiness

* **Cortex UDFs:** Sentiment analysis is packaged into functions for scalable, real-time inference.
* **Automated Pipelines:** Logic is deployable via **Snowflake Tasks** and **Stored Procedures** to refresh alpha scores daily.
* **Secure Governance:** All research and trade signals are auditable within a single secure schema.
